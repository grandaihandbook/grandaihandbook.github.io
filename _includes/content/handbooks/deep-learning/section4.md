Chapter 8: Foundations of CNNs
Motivation: Processing Grid-like Data (Images), Local Connectivity, Parameter Sharing, Translation Invariance/Equivariance.

The Convolution Operation: Filters/Kernels, Feature Maps, Stride, Padding ('valid' vs. 'same').

Pooling Layers: Max Pooling, Average Pooling (Purpose: Downsampling, Invariance).

Putting it Together: Typical CNN Layer Structure (CONV -> Activation -> POOL).

Chapter 9: Modern CNN Architectures
LeNet-5: The Pioneering Architecture.

AlexNet: Key innovations (ReLU, Dropout, Data Augmentation, GPUs).

VGGNets: Emphasizing Depth with Small Filters.

GoogLeNet / Inception: Wider Networks, Inception Modules, Factorized Convolutions.

ResNets (Residual Networks): Solving Vanishing Gradient with Skip/Residual Connections.

DenseNets: Connecting Layers Densely.

Efficient Architectures: MobileNets (Depthwise Separable Convolutions), EfficientNets (Compound Scaling).

Chapter 10: CNNs for Computer Vision Tasks
Image Classification: Using CNNs as feature extractors and classifiers.

Transfer Learning with CNNs: Using Pre-trained Models (e.g., on ImageNet).

Object Detection Introduction: Bounding Box Regression, Architectures Overview (R-CNN family, YOLO, SSD).

Semantic Segmentation Introduction: Pixel-wise Classification, Architectures Overview (FCN, U-Net).
