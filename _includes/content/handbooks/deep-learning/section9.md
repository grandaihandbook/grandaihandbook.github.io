Chapter 22: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Motivation: Applying DL to Graph-structured data.

Message Passing Framework: Aggregating information from neighbors.

Architectures: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), GraphSAGE (Inductive learning via sampling neighbors), Graph Attention Networks (GATs - using attention for neighbor aggregation).

Applications: Node Classification, Link Prediction, Graph Classification (Social Networks, Molecules, Recommendations).

Chapter 23: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
Combining Deep Learning (Function Approximation) with Reinforcement Learning.

Value-Based DRL: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) - Experience Replay, Target Networks. Variants (Double DQN, Dueling DQN).

Policy-Based DRL: Policy Gradients with Neural Networks (REINFORCE with baseline).

Actor-Critic Methods: Combining Value and Policy Learning (A2C/A3C, DDPG, TD3, SAC, PPO).

Applications: Mastering Games (Atari, Go, StarCraft), Robotics Control, Autonomous Systems.

Chapter 24: Geometric Deep Learning & Other Architectures
Geometric Deep Learning: Unifying framework (Symmetry, Invariance, Equivariance) for CNNs, GNNs, etc. (Conceptual).

Brief overview of other architectures if relevant (e.g., Capsule Networks - CapsNet, Liquid Neural Networks).
