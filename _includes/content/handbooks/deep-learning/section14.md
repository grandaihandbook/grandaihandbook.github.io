Chapter 39: Bias and Fairness in Deep Learning
Sources of Bias Amplified by DL: Data representation, Algorithmic choices, Lack of diversity in teams.

Detecting Bias: Auditing performance across subgroups, Analyzing embeddings (e.g., Word Embedding Association Test - WEAT), Fairness metrics revisited for DL contexts.

Mitigation Techniques: Fair data augmentation, Adversarial debiasing, Regularization methods, Fair representations. Challenges specific to large models.

Chapter 40: Explainability and Interpretability for Deep Models (XAI)
Challenges: Why DL models are often "black boxes".

Methods for CNNs: Saliency Maps, Grad-CAM / Grad-CAM++, Occlusion Sensitivity.

Methods for Transformers/NLP: Attention map visualization (caveats), Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), SHAP/LIME applicability.

Evaluating Explanations. Limitations of current methods.

Chapter 41: Privacy and Security in Deep Learning
Privacy Risks: Membership Inference, Model Inversion, Data Reconstruction from gradients/outputs.

Privacy-Preserving Techniques: Differential Privacy (DP-SGD), Federated Learning (Security aspects: Secure Aggregation), Encrypted Computation (HE/SMPC - performance challenges).

Adversarial Attacks: Evasion attacks (Adding small perturbations - FGSM, PGD, C&W), Poisoning attacks (Corrupting training data).

Adversarial Robustness and Defenses: Adversarial Training, Defensive Distillation, Certified Defenses. Arms race nature.
