Chapter 12: Metrics for Unlearning Efficacy

Removal Guarantees:

Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) to test if forgotten data is still recognizable.

Attribute Inference Attacks.

Reconstruction Attacks.

Distributional Similarity: Comparing the unlearned model's behavior/output distribution to a model retrained from scratch.

Task-Specific Probes for Forgotten Information.

Chapter 13: Metrics for Efficiency and Utility

Efficiency Metrics:

Unlearning Time (Wall-clock, CPU/GPU time).

Computational Cost (FLOPs).

Memory Overhead.

Model Utility Preservation Metrics:

Performance on Retained Data (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.).

Performance on Related Tasks (Transfer learning capabilities).

Fairness Metrics (Impact on demographic parity, equal opportunity, etc.).

Robustness to Adversarial Attacks.

Chapter 14: Benchmarking and Comparative Analysis

Standardized Datasets and Tasks for Unlearning Evaluation.

Public Benchmarks and Leaderboards (e.g., NeurIPS 2023 Machine Unlearning Competition, other relevant Kaggle competitions or academic challenges).

Methodologies for Fair Comparison of Unlearning Algorithms.

Challenges in Reproducibility and Ground Truth for Unlearning.
