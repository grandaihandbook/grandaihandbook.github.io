Chapter 1: The Imperative for Forgetting: Defining Machine Unlearning

What is Machine Unlearning? Core Concepts and Goals.

Why Unlearn? Motivations:

Privacy and Data Subject Rights (e.g., GDPR's Right to be Forgotten, CCPA).

Bias Mitigation and Fairness Enhancement.

Model Correction: Removing Outdated, Incorrect, or Poisoned Data.

Intellectual Property Protection.

Personalization and User Control.

Distinction from Related Concepts:

Data Deletion vs. Model Unlearning.

Incremental Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting.

Model Pruning and Compression.

Key Terminology: Data Point Unlearning, Sample Unlearning, Class Unlearning, Feature Unlearning, Concept Unlearning.

A Brief History and Evolution of Unlearning Research.

Chapter 2: The Unlearning Landscape: Scope and Challenges

Types of Unlearning Requests: Specific Data Points, Groups of Data, Entire Classes/Concepts.

Exact Unlearning vs. Approximate Unlearning.

High-Level Challenges:

Efficacy: Ensuring complete removal of influence.

Efficiency: Computational cost and time.

Utility Preservation: Minimizing impact on model performance for remaining data/tasks.

Verifiability: Proving that unlearning has occurred.

Scalability: Applying to large models and datasets.
