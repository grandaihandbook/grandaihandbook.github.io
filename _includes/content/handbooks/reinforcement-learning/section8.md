Chapter 31: Exploration Mechanisms
Problem Definition and Research Motivation
Research Directions: Balancing exploration/exploitation
Classic Exploration Mechanisms: Epsilon-greedy, UCB, Thompson sampling
Curiosity and Intrinsic Motivation:
Curiosity-driven RL: ICM (Intrinsic Curiosity Module)
Intrinsic Motivation: RND (Random Network Distillation), novelty-seeking
Goal-Oriented Exploration: HER (Hindsight Experience Replay)
Memory-Based Exploration: R2D2
Other Exploration Mechanisms: Novelty search, diversity-driven RL
Future Study: Generalizable exploration, lifelong learning
