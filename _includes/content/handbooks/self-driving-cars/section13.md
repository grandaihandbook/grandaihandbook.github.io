Chapter 33: Impact on Transportation and Mobility

Transformation of Personal Transportation (Shift from ownership to usership).

Rise of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) enabled by AVs.

Impact on Public Transport (First/Last mile solutions, integration with AVs).

Logistics and Goods Transportation (Autonomous Trucking, Delivery Robots).

Impact on specific sectors: Taxi industry, trucking industry, car repair.

Case Study: Potential impact of autonomous trucking on supply chains.

Chapter 34: Economic and Labor Market Impacts

New Industries and Job Creation (AV software engineers, sensor technicians, fleet operators, data scientists).

Job Displacement (Professional Drivers - taxi, truck, bus; driving instructors).

Economic Benefits: Increased Productivity, Reduced Congestion Costs, Fuel Savings, Accident Cost Reduction.

Requirements for Reskilling and Upskilling the Workforce.

Regional Economic Development around AV hubs.

Chapter 35: Environmental and Urban Planning Implications

Potential for Reduced Emissions: Optimized Driving, Electrification of AV fleets, Platooning.

Potential for Increased Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) due to ease of use.

Changes in Urban Design: Reduced Need for Parking Spaces, Repurposing of Road Space, Impact on Urban Sprawl.

Impact on Traffic Congestion (Potential for smoother flow or induced demand).

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of AVs considering manufacturing, operation, and disposal.
