Chapter 29: The AV Software Development Lifecycle (AVDevOps)

From Research Prototypes to Production-Grade Systems.

Agile Methodologies and Scrum in Automotive.

Requirements Engineering for Complex AV Functions.

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).

Data Collection and Annotation Pipelines: Tools (e.g., Scale AI, Supervisely, CVAT, Labelbox, Understand.ai), Quality Control, Active Learning.

Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD/CD) for AV Software.

MLOps for AVs: Managing ML model lifecycle, versioning, retraining.

Simulation-Driven Development.

Tools: Version control (Git), CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI), MLOps platforms (Kubeflow, MLflow, SageMaker).

Chapter 30: Large-Scale Testing, Deployment, and Operationalization

Geofenced Deployments (e.g., Robotaxis in specific cities, autonomous shuttles on campuses).

Gradual Expansion of ODDs based on testing and validation.

Collecting Real-World Data and Disengagement Analysis from deployed fleets.

Shadow Mode Operation: Running AV software in the background without actuating controls to gather data and test performance.

A/B Testing for software updates.

Incident Response and Post-Mortem Analysis.

Case Studies of Commercial Deployments: Waymo One (Phoenix, SF), Cruise (SF), Baidu Apollo Go (China), Motional (Las Vegas). Challenges faced and lessons learned.
