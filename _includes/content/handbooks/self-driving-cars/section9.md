Chapter 25: Human-Machine Interface (HMI) and User Experience (UX) for AVs

Communicating AV Status (Current Mode, Sensor View), Intentions (Planned Maneuvers), and Limitations (ODD boundaries, Confidence) to the Driver/Occupants.

Takeover Requests (TORs) in Level 3 Systems: Timing, Modalities, Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) for readiness.

Designing for Trust, Transparency, and Calibrated Reliance.

Information Displays (Dashboards, HUDs, Central Consoles), Auditory Cues, Haptic Feedback, Ambient Lighting.

Interaction with Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs): External HMI (eHMI) concepts for communicating AV intent to pedestrians and cyclists.

Personalization and User Preferences.

Tools: Prototyping tools (Figma, Sketch with automotive plugins), VR/AR for HMI development and testing.

Case Study: HMI design in current Level 2+/3 systems (e.g., Mercedes Drive Pilot).

Chapter 26: Trust, Acceptance, Ethics, and Data Privacy

Building Public Trust in AV Technology: Factors influencing trust (Perceived Safety, Reliability, Security, Understandability).

Factors Influencing User Acceptance (Perceived Usefulness, Ease of Use, Cost, Social Influence).

Ethical Dilemmas and Decision Making:

Trolley Problem variations in AV context â€“ limitations and alternative framings.

Moral Frameworks (Utilitarianism, Deontology) and their implementation challenges.

Value Alignment and crowd-sourced ethics (e.g., MIT Moral Machine).

Algorithmic Bias and Fairness in AV Decision Making (e.g., disparate impact on different demographic groups of pedestrians).

Data Privacy Concerns: Collection, Storage, and Use of sensor data, location data, user profiles. GDPR and other regulations. Privacy-Preserving Techniques.

Case Study: Public opinion surveys on AVs and their evolution.
