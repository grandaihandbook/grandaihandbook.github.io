What are Self-Driving Cars? Defining Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and their Potential.

A Brief History:

Early Concepts & Visionaries (e.g., Norman Bel Geddes' Futurama, GM Firebird II).

Pioneering Research Projects (e.g., NavLab at CMU, VaMoRs by Ernst Dickmanns, ARGO Project).

The DARPA Grand Challenges (2004, 2005) and Urban Challenge (2007) as Catalysts.

Emergence of Commercial R&D (Google Self-Driving Car Project, early OEM efforts).

Motivations for Autonomous Driving: Safety (Human Error Reduction), Efficiency (Traffic Flow, Fuel), Accessibility (Elderly, Disabled), Convenience, Economic Impact (Logistics, New Services).

Levels of Driving Automation (SAE J3016 Detailed):

Level 0: No Driving Automation.

Level 1: Driver Assistance (e.g., Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist - individual functions).

Level 2: Partial Driving Automation (e.g., Tesla Autopilot/FSD Beta, GM Super Cruise, Ford BlueCruise - combined longitudinal and lateral control, driver supervises).

Level 3: Conditional Driving Automation (System drives under specific conditions, driver must take back control when requested).

Level 4: High Driving Automation (System drives within a geofenced ODD without expecting driver intervention).

Level 5: Full Driving Automation (System drives anywhere, anytime, under all conditions a human could).

Key Terminology: AV, ADAS, ODD (Operational Design Domain), Fallback, Minimal Risk Condition (MRC), Disengagement, Safety Driver.

Overview of Key Components and Subsystems in an AV (The "AV Stack").

Case Study: The impact of the DARPA Challenges on AV development.

Chapter 2: The Autonomous Driving Ecosystem

Key Players and Their Roles:

Automotive OEMs (e.g., Ford, GM, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, VW Group, Hyundai).

Tier 1 & 2 Suppliers (e.g., Bosch, Continental, ZF, Magna, Aptiv, Valeo).

Full-Stack AV Technology Companies (e.g., Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, Motional, Zoox).

AI and Software Companies (e.g., NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel/Mobileye, Baidu Apollo).

Sensor Manufacturers (e.g., Velodyne, Luminar, Ouster (LiDAR); Infineon, NXP (RADAR); Sony, Omnivision (Cameras)).

Mapping and Localization Companies (e.g., HERE Technologies, TomTom, DeepMap, Ushr).

Ride-Hailing and Logistics Companies (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Waymo Via, TuSimple, Einride).

Research Institutions and Universities (e.g., CMU, Stanford, MIT, KIT).

Standardization Bodies and Consortia (e.g., SAE, ISO, IEEE, AUTOSAR, The AVCC, 5GAA).

The Role of Big Data, AI (Deep Learning), Cloud Computing, and Connectivity (5G, V2X).

Economic and Market Landscape: Investment Trends, Valuations, Business Models (Robotaxis, Autonomous Trucking, Personal AVs).

Public Perception, Acceptance, and Societal Concerns.

Case Study: The rise and fall (acquisition/pivot) of Argo AI â€“ lessons from the ecosystem.
