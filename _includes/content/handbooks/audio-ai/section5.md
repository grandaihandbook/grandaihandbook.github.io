Chapter 21: Sound Event Detection and Classification (SED/SEC)

Identifying and Classifying Sounds in Everyday Environments (e.g., car horn, dog bark, glass breaking, speech, music).

Weakly Labeled vs. Strongly Labeled Data.

Polyphonic Sound Event Detection (Detecting overlapping events).

Sound Localization and Tracking: Estimating the direction/position of sound sources.

Applications: Surveillance, Smart Homes, Wildlife Monitoring, Industrial Monitoring, Healthcare (e.g., cough detection).

Key Datasets and Challenges (e.g., ESC-50, UrbanSound8K, AudioSet, DCASE Challenge).

Chapter 22: Acoustic Scene Analysis and Classification

Classifying the Environment Based on its Overall Soundscape (e.g., office, park, street, restaurant).

Feature Engineering and Deep Learning Models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) for Scene Classification.

Datasets: DCASE Acoustic Scene Classification task datasets.

Chapter 23: Anomaly Detection in Audio

Identifying Unusual or Unexpected Sounds in a given context (e.g., machine fault, abnormal vocalizations).

Applications: Predictive Maintenance, Security, Healthcare Monitoring.

Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Approaches (Autoencoders, One-Class SVMs, Normalizing Flows).

Datasets: DCASE Challenge on Unsupervised Anomaly Detection.

Chapter 24: Bioacoustics and Animal Sound Analysis

Species Identification, Population Monitoring, Behavior Analysis through Animal Vocalizations.

Challenges: Large Datasets, Diverse Vocalizations, Noise, Fine-grained distinctions.

Applications in Ecology, Conservation, and Biodiversity Research.
