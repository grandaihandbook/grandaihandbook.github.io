Chapter 1: Introduction to Audio AI

What is Audio AI? Defining the Scope and Intersections.

The Significance of Audio: Communication, Art, Environment, Health, Entertainment.

Historical Milestones: From Early Speech Recognition to Modern Generative Audio.

Overview of Key Application Domains and Core Tasks:

Speech Processing (Recognition, Synthesis, Diarization, etc.)

Music AI (Generation, Analysis, Retrieval, Separation)

Environmental Sound AI (Event Detection, Scene Analysis, Localization)

Audio Enhancement and Restoration (Noise Suppression, Echo Cancellation)

Generative Audio (Synthesis of Speech, Music, Sound Effects)

Audio Understanding (Captioning, Question Answering)

The "Intelligence" in Audio AI: Perception, Understanding, Generation, Interaction.

High-Level Challenges in Audio AI (Noise, Variability, Data Scarcity, Real-time Processing, Interpretability, Scalability).

Key Conferences and Venues (e.g., ICASSP, Interspeech, WASPAA, DCASE Workshop).

Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Sound and Audio Signals

Physics of Sound: Waves, Frequency, Amplitude, Timbre, Phase.

Human Auditory Perception: Psychoacoustics, Masking, Loudness, Pitch Perception.

Digital Audio Representation: Sampling, Quantization, Bit Depth, Sample Rate, Aliasing.

Common Audio File Formats and Codecs (WAV, MP3, AAC, FLAC, Opus).

Basic Audio Terminology: Decibels (dB), Hertz (Hz), Spectrograms, Waveforms.

Chapter 3: Audio Signal Processing Essentials (Feature Extraction Focus)

Time-Domain Analysis: Zero-Crossing Rate, Short-Time Energy, Autocorrelation, Amplitude Envelopes.

Frequency-Domain Analysis: Fourier Transform (FT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Spectrograms (Linear, Mel, Log-Mel).

Filter Theory: Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass, Notch Filters, Filter Banks.

Core Audio Feature Extraction Techniques:

Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

Chromagrams, Spectral Contrast, Tonnetz (for music).

Zero-Crossing Rate, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Bandwidth, Spectral Rolloff, Spectral Flux.

Pitch Features (e.g., YIN, CREPE).

Signal Manipulation for Preprocessing: Normalization, Resampling, Denoising Basics, Silence Removal.

Chapter 4: Machine Learning Primer for Audio AI

Recap of Core ML Concepts: Supervised, Unsupervised, Self-Supervised Learning.
