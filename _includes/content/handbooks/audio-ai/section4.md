Chapter 16: Music Information Retrieval (MIR)

Core Tasks:

Music Classification (Genre, Mood, Artist, Era).

Music Tagging (Auto-tagging with descriptive labels).

Cover Song Identification.

Key-Finding, Chord Recognition, Beat Tracking, Tempo Estimation, Downbeat Tracking.

Structural Analysis (Segmentation into intro, verse, chorus).

Content-Based MIR vs. Symbolic MIR.

Music Similarity and Audio Recommendation Systems.

Key Datasets and Challenges (e.g., GTZAN, MagnaTagATune, FMA, MIREX).

Chapter 17: Algorithmic Music Composition and Generation

Rule-Based Systems vs. Machine Learning Approaches.

Generating Music with LSTMs, Transformers (e.g., Music Transformer, MuseNet), GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models (e.g., Jukebox, RAVE, MusicGen / MusicGen Melody).

Symbolic Music Generation (MIDI) vs. Raw Audio Generation.

Controllable Music Generation: Style, Genre, Instrumentation, Emotion, Melody/Harmony Control.

Human-AI Collaboration in Music Creation (Co-creative systems).

Evaluating Generated Music: Objective metrics (e.g., tonal distance, rhythmic complexity), Subjective listening tests.

Specialized models like Pop2Piano for transcription and generation.

Chapter 18: Music Transcription (Automatic Music Transcription - AMT)

Converting Audio to Symbolic Notation (e.g., MIDI, Piano Roll, Sheet Music).

Challenges: Polyphony, Instrument Identification, Expressive Timing/Dynamics, Diverse Timbres.

Piano Transcription (e.g., models like Pop2Piano), Drum Transcription, Multi-Instrument Transcription.

Key Datasets (e.g., MAESTRO, MAPS).

Chapter 19: Audio Source Separation for Music

Separating Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, and Other Stems from a Mix.

Models: U-Net based architectures (e.g., Spleeter, Open-Unmix), Demucs, Transformer-based separators.

Applications: Remixing, Karaoke Track Generation, Music Education, Audio Editing.

Chapter 20: Music Synthesis and Virtual Instruments

Synthesizing Realistic and Expressive Instrument Sounds.

Physical Modeling vs. Sample-Based Synthesis vs. Neural Synthesis.

Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) for timbre synthesis and control.

Neural Vocoders adapted for instrument synthesis.
