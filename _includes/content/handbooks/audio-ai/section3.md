Decoding Algorithms: Beam Search, Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs).

Challenges: Noise Robustness, Speaker Variability, Accents, Dialects, Far-Field ASR, Low-Resource Languages, Multilingual ASR (e.g., models like MMS).

Evaluation Metrics: Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER).

Key Datasets and Challenges (e.g., LibriSpeech, Switchboard, Interspeech ASR challenges).

Chapter 12: Text-to-Speech (TTS) / Speech Synthesis

TTS Pipeline: Text Processing (Normalization, Grapheme-to-Phoneme, Prosody Prediction), Acoustic Model/Spectrogram Prediction, Vocoder/Waveform Generation.

Traditional TTS: Concatenative, Parametric (HMM-based).

Neural TTS:

Spectrogram Prediction Models (e.g., Tacotron series, FastSpeech2 / FastSpeech series, Glow-TTS).

Vocoders (e.g., WaveNet, WaveGlow, HiFi-GAN, MelGAN, UnivNet, Vocos).

End-to-End TTS Models (e.g., VITS, EATS, Bark).

Controllable TTS: Style (Expressive TTS), Emotion, Voice Conversion, Cross-Lingual TTS (e.g., models like MMS), Zero-Shot/Few-Shot Speaker Adaptation.

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Naturalness, Intelligibility, Speaker Similarity.

Key Datasets and Challenges (e.g., LJSpeech, VCTK, Interspeech TTS challenges).

Chapter 13: Speaker Recognition and Diarization

Speaker Verification (1:1) vs. Speaker Identification (1:N).

Speaker Embedding Techniques (x-vectors, d-vectors, ECAPA-TDNN, ResNet-based, Transformer-based).

Speaker Diarization: Who Spoke When? (Clustering-based, End-to-End Neural Diarization - EEND).

Challenges: Short Utterances, Noise, Overlapping Speech, Variable Channels, Large-Scale Populations.

Chapter 14: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

Features for SER (Acoustic, Lexical, Spectrogram-based, Embeddings).

Models for SER (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, Multimodal approaches).

Databases and Benchmarks for SER (e.g., IEMOCAP, RAVDESS).

Challenges: Subjectivity, Cultural Differences, Context Dependency, Imbalanced Data.

Chapter 15: Speech Enhancement, Restoration, and Separation

Goal: Improving Speech Quality, Intelligibility, and Separability.

Noise Suppression/Reduction: Traditional (Spectral Subtraction, Wiener Filtering) and Deep Learning-based (Masking, Mapping, e.g., SEW / SEW-D).

Echo Cancellation: Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) using adaptive filters and deep learning.

Dereverberation.

Speech Separation (Cocktail Party Problem): Separating multiple concurrent speakers (e.g., Deep Clustering, Permutation Invariant Training - PIT, TasNet).

Applications: Hearing Aids, Communication Systems, ASR Preprocessing.
