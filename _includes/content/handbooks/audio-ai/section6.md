Music: GTZAN, MagnaTagATune, FMA (Free Music Archive), MAESTRO, MedleyDB, Slakh.

Environmental Sounds: ESC-50, UrbanSound8K, AudioSet, FSD50K.

Specialized Datasets (Emotion, Medical, Animal Sounds, etc.).

Data Collection Strategies, Ethical Considerations, and Annotation Challenges.

Data Annotation Tools and Platforms for Audio.

The Role of Academic Challenges and Kaggle Competitions:

DCASE (Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events)

Interspeech Challenges (ASR, TTS, Paralinguistics, etc.)

ICASSP Grand Challenges

Various Kaggle Competitions focusing on audio tasks (e.g., bird sound classification, speech recognition).

Chapter 26: Audio Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

Cleaning and Normalizing Audio Data (Amplitude, DC offset).

Handling Imbalanced Datasets (Oversampling, Undersampling, Synthetic Data Generation).

Data Augmentation Techniques for Audio:

Time-Domain: Time Stretching, Pitch Shifting, Adding Noise (Background, White, Pink), Random Cropping, Mixing (Mixup, CutMix for audio), Reverberation, Filtering.

Frequency-Domain: SpecAugment (Time warping, Frequency masking, Time masking).

Importance of Augmentation for Model Robustness and Generalization.
