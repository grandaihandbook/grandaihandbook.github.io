Section I: Introduction to AI Agents

Chapter 1: Defining AI Agents
Core Concepts: Perception, Action, Environment, Goals, Autonomy, Agency
History and Evolution of Agent Concepts (Logic-based, BDI, LLM-based)
Agents vs. Traditional AI/ML Models vs. Automation Scripts
The Agentic Paradigm Shift in AI
Overview of Key Applications (Personal Assistants, Automation, Robotics, Simulation, etc.)
High-Level Challenges (Reasoning, Safety, Scalability, World Knowledge, Alignment)
Chapter 2: Agent Architectures
Reactive Agents
Deliberative Agents (e.g., BDI - Belief-Desire-Intention)
Hybrid Architectures
LLM-Based Agent Architectures (e.g., ReAct, Reflection, Tree-of-Thought)
Cognitive Architectures (e.g., SOAR, ACT-R - for foundational context)
Chapter 3: The AI Agent Ecosystem
Key Players: Researchers, Framework Developers, Application Builders, Cloud Providers
Relationship to LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, Planning, Robotics, NLP
Open Source vs. Proprietary Agent Platforms and Frameworks
