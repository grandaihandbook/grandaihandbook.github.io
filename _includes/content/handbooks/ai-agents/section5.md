Section V: Agent Deployment and Interaction

Chapter 15: Deployment Strategies
Cloud-Based Deployment (Serverless Functions, Containers, Managed Services)
Edge Deployment for Agents (IoT Devices, Robotics Platforms)
Hybrid Deployment Models (Cloud Orchestration, Edge Execution)
Scalability Patterns for Agent Systems (Load Balancing, Asynchronous Processing)
Chapter 16: Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)
Designing User Interfaces and Interaction Modalities for Agents
Communication Styles: Natural Language (Text, Voice) vs. Structured Inputs
Role of Hub LLMs in Parsing Human NL for Agent Systems
Establishing Trust, Transparency, and User Control
Mixed-Initiative Interaction: Collaboration, Oversight, Correction, Feedback Mechanisms
Chapter 17: Agent Communication Fundamentals
Introduction to Agent Communication Needs (Coordination, Information Sharing)
Message Types:
Structured Messages (JSON, XML, Code): Pros (Efficiency, Precision), Cons (Limited Expressiveness)
Unstructured Messages (Natural Language, Vision, Audio): Pros (Richness, Context), Cons (Ambiguity, Parsing Complexity)
Basic Agent-Agent Communication Modes:
Natural Language-Based Exchange
Structured Information Exchange
