Section VII: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

Chapter 22: MAS Architectures
Centralized vs. Decentralized Control Models
Organizational Structures (Hierarchies, Teams, Swarms)
Communication Patterns and Network Topologies
Chapter 23: Agent Communication Protocols and Standards
The Need for Unified Frameworks: Addressing Fragmentation and Siloed Ecosystems
Key Design Dimensions: Identity/Security, Meta-protocol Negotiation, Flexibility, Centralization
Overview of Next-Generation Protocols:

ANP (Agent Network Protocol): Decentralized, DIDs, P2P, Meta-protocol negotiation
Agora: Decentralized, Language-driven Protocol Descriptions (PDs)
Comparative Analysis and Standardization Efforts
Challenges: Scalability, Semantic Interoperability, Dynamic Protocol Adaptation
Chapter 24: Coordination and Collaboration
