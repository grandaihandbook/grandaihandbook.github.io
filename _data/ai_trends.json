        "description": "A deep dive into agent frameworks, arguing that the core challenge in building reliable agentic systems is ensuring the LLM has appropriate context. The article distinguishes between agents and workflows, analyzes different types of frameworks (declarative vs. imperative, abstractions), highlights essential features frameworks should provide (memory, human-in-the-loop, streaming, observability), and positions LangGraph as an orchestration framework built for this complexity. It also critiques common misconceptions about agent frameworks.",
