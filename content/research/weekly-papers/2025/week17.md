          <p>This paper investigates whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) truly enhances LLM reasoning capacity or merely improves sampling efficiency of existing capabilities.</p>
          <ul class="paper-points">
            <li>RLVR improves sample efficiency (pass@k for low k) but not reasoning capacity (pass@k for large k).</li>

            <li>Distillation from stronger models is shown to introduce genuinely new reasoning patterns.</li>
            <li>Current RL algorithms offer similar sample-efficiency gains but don't close the large k performance gap.</li>
