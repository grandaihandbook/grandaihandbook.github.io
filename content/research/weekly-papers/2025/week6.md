- Key contribution: Evidence that 100B+ parameter models can develop multi-step planning

# Trends and Patterns

The papers this week show a clear trend toward structured prompting techniques that decompose complex reasoning tasks into manageable steps.

# Notable Quotes

"The boundary between explicit and implicit reasoning in these models appears more fluid than previously understood." - Smith et al.
